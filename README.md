# Java-PatternProject# Java Pattern Printing Project (Menu Driven)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Menu Driven Pattern Printing Application** developed in **Java** as part of my **BCA 2nd Year, Semester 3** coursework at **Dezyne École College, Ajmer**.  
The project demonstrates how different **patterns** (stars, numbers, shapes) can be printed using **loops and modular programming**.

---

## 🎯 Features
- **Interactive Menu** – Select the desired pattern from a console-based menu.
- **Multiple Pattern Options** – Star patterns, numeric patterns, and more.
- **Custom Input** – Enter the size/rows for patterns dynamically.
- **Loop-based Logic** – Uses `for` and `while` loops for generating designs.
- **Exit Anytime** – Option to close the program from the menu.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans / VS Code)
- **Concepts Applied:** Loops, Nested Loops, Methods, Menu Driven Programming
